    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2.   **Loading Pre-trained models**: To obtain better performances, we leverage pre-trained models for word embeddings.

    "In the development of question-answering systems, having a context for each question is often crucial. Typically, models are trained to understand and retrieve answers within a given context. However, our dataset contains only question and answers without any additional context.\n",
    "This challenge presents a valuable opportunity for us to apply our knowledge to build a pseudo-document search engine. This search engine will enable us to retrieve relevant context for a given question, which can then be used for model training or other specific tasks.\n",
    "The main steps of our process of context retrievel are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Keyword Extraction**: extract a set of kywords that capture the essence of the question using a pre-trained model, such as KeyBERT\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Context Retrival**: using the extracted keywords as queries, we utilize the PubMedAPI to search for relevant documents through a vast repository of medical documents, extracting the most relevant ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "  *  **TF-IDF and BM25 Index Search**:  These methods assess the importance of terms based on their frequencies within the retrieved contexts and the question itself\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Document vectorization**: utilizing a TD-IDF vectorizer, we compute the textual documents into numerical vectors based on the relevancy of the words and how often they appear in the documents, enabling quantitative comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Sentence Embedding and Cosine Similarity**: compute sentence embeddings for both the question and the retrieved contexts, then evaluate the cosine similarities between them to obtain similarity scores. This process allows us to rank the contexts based on their relevance to the question\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The last method indeed yielded the best results, as it effectively maintains the semantic relationships between words. This capability enchances the matching process, enabling a more accurate alignment of the question with the context.\n",
    "Using these methods, we were able to obtain sufficiently accurate contexts to associate with the questions. However, the effictiveness of this approach is limited by the quaility and reliablity of the external sources we use, as well as the performance of the models employed for document embeddings and the comparison between the documents and the query. Additionally, the computational complexity and time required for retriving and processing the context can also impact the efficiency of the system. Despite these limitations, this approach significantly enhances our ability to provide more relevant and contextually accurate answers\n",
