This presents a unique challenge: how can we train an effective question-answering model without inherent contextual information ?\n","\n","**Importance of Context**\n","\n","Context is often vital because it provides the backgrounf information needed for understanding and accurately answering. Without context, the model may struggle to comprehend the nuances and specifics of the questions, leasinf to lower accuracy and reliablity\n","\n","**Challenges without context**\n","\n","\n","\n","1.   **Ambiguity**: question cab be ambiguous without context\n","2.   **Relevance**: without context, it is challenging to determine which information is relevant to the question\n","3.   **Depth of understanding**: context allows the model to provide more comprehensive and detailed answers\n","\n","**Proposed Solutions**\n","\n","\n","**Using External Sources for Context Retrieval**:\n","\n"," To address the absence of context in our dataset, we propose a method that involves retrieving relevant context from external sources, specifically leveraging the PubMed API to access medical and biomedical papers and their abstracts. Here's an overview of our approach:\n","\n","\n"," -  **Keyword Extraction**: for each question, we employ keyBERT, a pre-trained mdoel, to extract a set of keywords that capture the essence of the question. These keywords serve as the query terms for retrieving relevant papers and their contexts\n","\n"," - **Context Retrival**: using the extracted keywords as queries, we utilize the PubMedAPI to search through a vast repository of medical literature. This step aims to retrieve potential contexts from papers and their abstracts, ensuring that the context is domain-specific and directly relevant to the question at hand\n","\n"," - **Preprocessing and Cleaning**: the retrieved contexts undergo preprocessing and cleaning to ensure they are in the appropriate format for futher analysis. This preprocessing involves removing irrelevant information, normalizing text, and ensuring consistency across retrieved contexts.\n","\n"," - **Context Ranking**: to prioritize the retrieved contexts, we employ various ranking techniques:\n","\n","    - **TF-IDF and BM25 Index Search**: These methods assess the importance of terms based on their frequencies within the retrieved contexts and the question itself. This allows us to build a document search engine that matches contexts to a given query (question).\n","\n","    - **Document vectorization**: utilizing a TD-IDF vectorizer, we compute the textual documents into numerical vectors based on the relevancy of the words and how often they appear in the documents, enabling quantitative comparison.\n","\n","    - **Sentence Embedding and Cosine Similarity**: We compute sentence embeddings for both the question and the retrieved contexts, then evaluate the cosine similarities between them to obtain similarity scores. This process allows us to rank the contexts based on their relevance to the question. Unlike the previous methods that only consider term frequency, this approach captures the semantic meaning and relationships between words within the sentences.\n","\n","The last method indeed yielded the best results, as it effectively maintains the semantic relationships between words. This capability enchances the matching process, enabling a more accurate alignment of the question with the context. By considering not only the frequency of terms but also their semantic meaning, this methos provides a more  nuanced understanding of the relationship between the question and the retrieved contexts. This ensures that the generated responses are not only relevant in terms of topic but also in terms of undrlying semantic context, resulting in more precise and informative answers\n","\n","\n","\n","2.  **Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Models**\n","Another solution is to leverage pre-trained models and fine-tune them for our question-answering task. This approach takes advantage of the vast knowledge these models have already acquired during their training\n","\n","\n","3. **Leveraging Open-Domain Pre-Trained Models**\n","In addition to domain-specific models, we can also consider open-domain pre-trained models. Literature shows that models trained on vast, open-domain knowledge have performed well on question-answering tasks after fine-tuning.\n","\n","**Our Work**\n","\n","In the forthcoming notebook, we will delve into the process of retrieving external context for each question in our dataset. This endeavor will empower us to construct a comprehensive context for every question, a crucial asset in training models that rely on contextual information for optimal performance."],"metadata":{"id":"LzsM3nGUbv8S"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Import and Install"],"metadata":{"id":"H3Ib1PfFw9E3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Let's install some

Nasal irrigation is a more rarely reported route of \n","infection.\n","CASE PRESENTATION: A fatal case of PAM in a previously healthy Norwegian woman, \n","acquired during a holiday trip to Thailand, is described. Clinical findings were \n","consistent with rapidly progressing meningoencephalitis. The cause of infection \n","was discovered by chance, owing to the unexpected detection of N. fowleri DNA by \n","a PCR assay targeting fungi. A conclusive diagnosis was established based on \n","sequencing of N. fowleri DNA from brain biopsies, supported by histopathological \n","findings. Nasal irrigation using contaminated tap water is suspected as the \n","source of infection.\n","CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation of PAM is very similar to severe bacterial \n","meningitis. This case is a reminder that when standard investigations fail to \n","identify a cause of infection in severe meningoencephalitis, it is of crucial \n","importance to continue a broad search for a conclusive diagnosis. PAM should be \n","considered as a diagnosis in patients with symptoms of severe \n","meningoencephalitis returning from endemic areas.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### BM25 Index

Infection occurs by insufflation of \n","water containing amoebae into the nasal cavity, and is usually associated with \n","bathing in freshwater. Nasal irrigation is a more rarely reported route of \n","infection.\n","CASE PRESENTATION: A fatal case of PAM in a previously healthy Norwegian woman, \n","acquired during a holiday trip to Thailand, is described. Clinical findings were \n","consistent with rapidly progressing meningoencephalitis. The cause of infection \n","was discovered by chance, owing to the unexpected detection of N. fowleri DNA by \n","a PCR assay targeting fungi. A conclusive diagnosis was established based on \n","sequencing of N. fowleri DNA from brain biopsies, supported by histopathological \n","findings. Nasal irrigation using contaminated tap water is suspected as the \n","source of infection.\n","CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation of PAM is very similar to severe bacterial \n","meningitis. This case is a reminder that when standard investigations fail to \n","identify a cause of infection in severe meningoencephalitis, it is of crucial \n","importance to continue a broad search for a conclusive diagnosis. PAM should be \n","considered as a diagnosis in patients with symptoms of severe \n","meningoencephalitis returning from endemic areas.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###

Infection occurs by insufflation of \n","water containing amoebae into the nasal cavity, and is usually associated with \n","bathing in freshwater. Nasal irrigation is a more rarely reported route of \n","infection.\n","CASE PRESENTATION: A fatal case of PAM in a previously healthy Norwegian woman, \n","acquired during a holiday trip to Thailand, is described. Clinical findings were \n","consistent with rapidly progressing meningoencephalitis. The cause of infection \n","was discovered by chance, owing to the unexpected detection of N. fowleri DNA by \n","a PCR assay targeting fungi.

Infection occurs by insufflation of water containing amoeba into the nasal cavity and is usually associated with bathing in freshwater Nasal irrigation is a more rarely reported route of infection CASE PRESENTATION A fatal case of PAM in a previously healthy Norwegian woman acquired during a holiday trip to Thailand is described Clinical finding were consistent with rapidly progressing meningoencephalitis The cause of infection wa discovered by chance owing to the unexpected detection of N fowleri DNA by a PCR assay targeting fungi A conclusive diagnosis wa established based on sequencing of N fowleri DNA from brain biopsy supported by histopathological finding Nasal irrigation using contaminated tap water is suspected a the source of infection CONCLUSION The clinical presentation of PAM is very similar to severe bacterial meningitis This case is a reminder that when standard investigation fail to identify a cause of infection in severe meningoencephalitis it is of crucial importance to continue a broad search for a conclusive diagnosis PAM should be considered a a diagnosis in patient with symptom of severe meningoencephalitis returning from endemic

publicly available but the genetic basis for Naegleria diversity and ability to thrive in diverse environment including human brain remains unclear METHODS Herein we constructed a highquality Naegleria genus pangenome to obtain a comprehensive catalog of gene encoded by these amoeba For this we first sequenced assembled and annotated six new Naegleria genome RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Genome architecture analysis revealed that Naegleria may use genome plasticity feature such a ploidyaneuploidy to modulate their behavior in different environment When comparing 14 neartocomplete genome sequence our result estimated the theoretical Naegleria pangenome a a closed genome with 13943 gene including 3563 core and 10380 accessory gene The functional annotation revealed that a large fraction of Naegleria gene show significant sequence similarity with those already described in other kingdom namely Animalia and Plantae Comparative analysis highlighted a remarkable genomic heterogeneity even for closely related strain and demonstrate that Naegleria harbor extensive genome variability reflected in different metabolic repertoire If Naegleria core genome wa enriched in conserved gene essential for metabolic regulatory and survival process the accessory genome revealed the presence of gene involved in stress response macromolecule modification cell signaling and immune response Commonly reported N fowleri virulenceassociated gene were present in both core and accessory genome suggesting that N fowleris ability to infect human brain could be related to it unique speciesspecific gene mostly of unknown function andor to differential gene expression The construction of Naegleria first pangenome allowed u to move away from a single reference genome that doe not necessarily represent each specie a a whole and to identify essential and dispensable gene in Naegleria evolution diversity and biology paving the way for further genomic and postgenomic

which are freeliving thermophilic ameba found in freshwater and soil worldwide only Naegleria fowleri infects human causing primary amebic meningoencephalitis PAM a typically fatal brain disease To understand the population structure of Naegleria specie and the genetic relationship between N fowleri isolates and to detect pathogenic factor we characterized 52 novel clinical and environmental N fowleri genome and a single Naegleria lovaniensis strain along with transcriptomic data for a subset of 37 N fowleri isolates Wholegenome analysis of 56 isolates from three Naegleria specie N fowleri N lovaniensis and Naegleria gruberi identified several gene unique to N fowleri that have previously been linked to the pathogenicity of N fowleri while other unique gene could be associated with novel pathogenicity factor in this highly fatal pathogen Population structure analysis estimated the presence of 10 population within the three Naegleria specie of which 7 population were within N fowleri The wholenucleargenome WNG phylogenetic analysis showed an overall geographical clustering of N fowleri isolates with few exception and provided higher resolution in identifying potential cluster of isolates beyond that of the traditional locus typing There were only 34 gene that showed significant difference in gene expression between the clinical and environmental isolates Genomic data generated in this study can be used for developing rapid molecular assay and to conduct future populationbased global genomic analysis and will also be a valuable addition to genomic reference database where shotgun metagenomics data from routine water sample could be searched for the presence of N fowleri strain IMPORTANCE N fowleri the only known Naegleria specie to infect human cause fatal brain disease PAM case from 1965 to 2016 showed 20 case per year globally Out of approximately 150 case in North America since 1962 only four PAM survivor are known yielding a 97 case fatality

reportable disease the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC document a total of 143 case in the United States Only four patient have survived Infection result from water containing N fowleri entering the nose followed by migration of the ameba to the brain Within the brain N fowleri infection result in extensive necrosis leading to death in 37 day Mortality among patient with PAM is greater than 95 The drug of choice in treating PAM are the antifungal amphotericin B and the antileishmanial miltefosine However neither drug is FDAapproved for this indication and the use of amphotericin B is associated with severe adverse effect Moreover very few patient treated with amphotericin B have survived PAM Therefore development of new safe and effective drug is a critical unmet need to avert future death of child The molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of PAM are poorly understood but it is known that cysteine protease of N fowleri play a role in the progression of PAM We therefore assessed the in vitro activity of the synthetic vinyl sulfone cysteine protease inhibitor K11777 and 33 analog with valine phenylalanine or pyridylalanine at P2 position against cysteine protease activity in the lysate of N fowleri Inhibitors with phenylalanine or pyridylalanine at P2 position were particularly effective in inhibiting the cysteine protease activity of N fowleri cell lysate with IC50 ranging between 3 nM and 66 μM Three of the 34 inhibitor also showed inhibitory activity against N fowleri in a cell viability assay and were 16 to 25fold more potent than the standard of care drug miltefosine Our study provides the first evidence of the activity of synthetic small molecule cysteine protease inhibitor against N fowleri\n","Cosine Similarity :

migrates to the brain Patient exposure to water containing the ameba typically occurs in warm freshwater lake and pond during recreational water activity In June 2016 an 18yearold woman died of PAM after traveling to North Carolina where she participated in rafting on an artificial whitewater river METHODS We conducted an epidemiologic and environmental investigation to determine the water exposure that led to the death of this patient RESULTS The case patient most probable water exposure occurred while rafting on an artificial whitewater river during which she wa thrown out of the raft and submerged underwater The approximately 115 million gallon of water in the whitewater facility were partially filtered subjected to ultraviolet light treatment and occasionally chlorinated Heavy algal growth wa noted Eleven waterrelated sample were collected from the facility all were positive for N fowleri Of 5 sample collected from the nearby natural river 1 sediment sample wa positive for N fowleri CONCLUSIONS This investigation document a novel exposure to an artificial whitewater river a the likely exposure causing PAM in this case Conditions in the whitewater facility warm turbid water with little chlorine and heavy algal growth rendered the water treatment ineffective and provided an ideal environment for N fowleri to thrive The combination of natural and engineered element at the whitewater facility created a challenging environment to control the growth of N fowleri\n","Cosine Similarity : 0.351803453306532\n","\n","\n","Document: On November 21 2012 the US Virgin

the population structure of Naegleria specie and the genetic relationship between N fowleri isolates and to detect pathogenic factor we characterized 52 novel clinical and environmental N fowleri genome and a single Naegleria lovaniensis strain along with transcriptomic data for a subset of 37 N fowleri isolates Wholegenome analysis of 56 isolates from three Naegleria specie N fowleri N lovaniensis and Naegleria gruberi identified several gene unique to N fowleri that have previously been linked to the pathogenicity of N fowleri while other unique gene could be associated with novel pathogenicity factor in this highly fatal pathogen Population structure analysis estimated the presence of 10 population within the three Naegleria specie of which 7 population were within N fowleri The wholenucleargenome WNG phylogenetic analysis showed an overall geographical clustering of N fowleri isolates with few exception and provided higher resolution in identifying potential cluster of isolates beyond that of the traditional locus typing There were only 34 gene that showed significant difference in gene expression between the clinical and environmental isolates Genomic data generated in this study can be used for developing rapid molecular assay and to conduct future populationbased global genomic analysis and will also be a valuable addition to genomic reference

primary amoebic meningoencephalitis Some Naegleria genome sequence are publicly available but the genetic basis for Naegleria diversity and ability to thrive in diverse environment including human brain remains unclear METHODS Herein we constructed a highquality Naegleria genus pangenome to obtain a comprehensive catalog of gene encoded by these amoeba For this we first sequenced assembled and annotated six new Naegleria genome RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Genome architecture analysis revealed that Naegleria may use genome plasticity feature such a ploidyaneuploidy to modulate their behavior in different environment When comparing 14 neartocomplete genome sequence our result estimated the theoretical Naegleria pangenome a a closed genome with 13943 gene including 3563 core and 10380 accessory gene The functional annotation revealed that a large fraction of Naegleria gene show significant sequence similarity with those already described in other kingdom namely Animalia and Plantae Comparative analysis highlighted a remarkable genomic heterogeneity even for closely related strain and demonstrate that Naegleria harbor extensive genome variability reflected in different metabolic repertoire If Naegleria core genome wa enriched in conserved gene essential for metabolic regulatory and survival process the accessory genome revealed the presence of gene involved in stress response macromolecule modification cell signaling and immune response Commonly reported N fowleri virulenceassociated gene were present in both core and accessory genome suggesting that N fowleris ability to infect human brain could be related to it unique speciesspecific gene mostly of unknown function andor to differential gene expression The construction of Naegleria first pangenome allowed u to move away from a single reference genome that doe not necessarily represent each specie a a whole and to identify essential and dispensable gene in Naegleria evolution diversity and biology paving the way

fatal case of PAM in a previously healthy Norwegian woman acquired during a holiday trip to Thailand is described Clinical finding were consistent with rapidly progressing meningoencephalitis The cause of infection wa discovered by chance owing to the unexpected detection of N fowleri DNA by a PCR assay targeting fungi A conclusive diagnosis wa established based on sequencing of N fowleri DNA from brain biopsy supported by histopathological finding Nasal irrigation using contaminated tap water is suspected a the source of infection CONCLUSION The clinical presentation of PAM is very similar to severe bacterial meningitis This case is a reminder that when standard investigation fail to identify a cause of infection in severe meningoencephalitis it is of crucial importance to continue a broad search for a conclusive diagnosis PAM should be considered a a diagnosis in patient with symptom of severe meningoencephalitis returning from endemic area\n","Cosine Similarity :

protist clade Heterolobosea and are ubiquitously distributed in soil and freshwater habitat Of the 47 Naegleria specie described N fowleri is the only one being pathogenic to human causing a rare but fulminant primary amoebic meningoencephalitis Some Naegleria genome sequence are publicly available but the genetic basis for Naegleria diversity and ability to thrive in diverse environment including human brain remains unclear METHODS Herein we constructed a highquality Naegleria genus pangenome to obtain a comprehensive catalog of gene encoded by these amoeba For this we first sequenced assembled and annotated six new Naegleria genome RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Genome architecture analysis revealed that Naegleria may use genome plasticity feature such a ploidyaneuploidy to modulate their behavior in different environment When comparing 14 neartocomplete genome sequence our result estimated the theoretical Naegleria pangenome a a closed genome with 13943 gene including 3563 core and 10380 accessory gene The functional annotation revealed that a large fraction of Naegleria gene show significant sequence similarity with those already described in other kingdom namely Animalia and Plantae Comparative analysis highlighted a remarkable genomic heterogeneity even for closely related strain and demonstrate that Naegleria harbor extensive genome variability reflected in different metabolic repertoire If Naegleria core genome wa enriched in conserved gene essential for metabolic regulatory and survival process the accessory genome revealed the presence of gene involved in stress response macromolecule modification cell signaling and immune response Commonly reported N fowleri virulenceassociated gene were present in both core and accessory genome suggesting that N

PAM should beconsidered as a diagnosis in patients with symptoms of severemeningoencephalitis returning from endemic areas.\n","\n","TF-IDF Vectorizer: Fatal primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in a Norwegian tourist returning fromThailand.\n","\n","Doc2Vec:  Author information 1National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Centers for Disease Control and Prevention1600 Clifton Road Atlanta GA 30329 USA jey9cdcgov\n","\n","sentence transformers: Balamuthia mandrillaris is an amoeba found in fresh water and soil that cause granulomatous amoebic encephalitis We report herein an autopsy case of B mandrillaris amoebic  encephalitis which wa definitely diagnosed by PCR An 81yearold man who had Sjögrens syndrome   manifested drowsiness 2 month before his death with progressive deterioration Neuroimaging    demonstrated focus of T2 and fluidattenuated inversion recovery high and T1 lowintensity with     irregular postcontrast ring enhancement in the cerebral hemisphere thalamus and midbrain      Pathologically multiple hemorrhagic and necrotic lesion were found in the cerebrum thalamus       midbrain pons medulla and cerebellum which were characterized by liquefactive necrosis marked         edema hemorrhage and necrotizing vasculitis associated with the perivascular accumulation of amoebic         trophozoite a few cyst and the infiltration of numerous neutrophil and microgliamacrophages The trophozoite          were ovoid or round 1060 μm in diameter and they showed foamy cytoplasm and a round nucleus with small           karyosome in the center The PCR and immunohistochemistry from paraffinembedded brain specimen revealed            angioinvasive encephalitis due to B mandrillaris Human case of B mandrillaris brain infection are rare             in Japan with only a few brief report in the literature\n","\n","BioSentVec: INTRODUCTION Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis PAM is a rare disease caused by the freeliving amoeba Naegleria fowleri Infection occurs by insufflation of water containing amoeba into the nasal cavity  and is usually associated with bathing in freshwater Nasal irrigation is a more rarely reported route of infection   CASE PRESENTATION A fatal case of PAM in a previously healthy Norwegian woman acquired during a holiday trip    to Thailand is described Clinical finding were consistent with rapidly progressing meningoencephalitis     The cause of infection wa discovered by chance owing to the unexpected detection of N fowleri DNA by a      PCR assay targeting fungi A conclusive diagnosis wa established based on sequencing of N fowleri DNA       from brain biopsy supported by histopathological finding Nasal irrigation using contaminated tap water        is suspected a the source of infection CONCLUSION The clinical presentation of PAM is very similar to         severe bacterial meningitis This case is a reminder that when standard investigation fail to identify          a cause of infection in severe meningoencephalitis it is of crucial importance to continue a broad search           for a conclusive diagnosis PAM should be considered a a diagnosis in patient with symptom of severe            meningoencephalitis returning from endemic area\n","\n"]}]}]}
